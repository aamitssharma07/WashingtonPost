    "Ha! There is a huge long list of luxuries \"real people\" corporations get to write-off which the \"small people\" don't get to write-off.\n\nI spent my career working mostly for small companies. Often startups. Having a nice fancy'ish lunch or dinner was all about just figuring out how to make an excuse why it was a business write-off. Having the business lease higher-end cars which are really for personal use and writing-off the lease payments.\n\nNow it's important to understand small businesses only have so much money to responsibly spend. So executives simply trade reduced cash compensation for the business covering three martini lunches, fancy autos, etc. That's a \"win\" for the executives, and a \"lose\" for the \"small guy\" American taxpayer.\n\nThe business doles out the same amount of money, just as perks instead of cash compensation. (Either way would have been a write-off for the business.) The executive gets \"more\" because s/he doesn't have to pay income tax on the cash they would have needed to cover the cost of the perks the business is giving them.\n\nNote how none of this involves actual \"real cost of doing business\" which, under proper non-corrupt capitalism, is the only thing a business should get to write-off. Expensive cars are not a \"real\" cost of doing business, and the executives would buy personal cars anyway if the business didn't supply them. Executives, like every \"small guy\", would presumably still eat lunch and dinner if the business wasn't paying for luxury meals.\n\nUnder proper non-corrupt capitalism, the only \"expenses\" are supposed to be the \"real cost of doing business\".\n\nTo be fair, how much of this tax corruption goes on at a business does vary how much the business makes. A small mom and pop corner store or eatery is typically tight on cash and thus can't fund much of this corruption. Although they get away with little tax write-off perks by, for example, using food from their business which they're writing-off as a business expense.",

Once again, just itching to give themselves more, which drives republicans to do this legislation. NOT care about the poor!!

For example, if you have 2 other dependents, your credit is $1000. But if your tax liability is $900, the credit erases that but the extra $100 cannot be claimed as refund.\n\nITINs are issued to anyone who has some kind of proof of ID and has a need to be on an American tax return.IRS doesn't care if you're legally here or not.

What seniors need is a fair formula for IRMA and a steady rate of withdrawal around 3.5 or 3.7%. That eliminates the torpedo.

    "How about a tax credit for Seniors who move into independent living Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRC). The CCRC require an initial buy in and then steep monthly costs to live in independent apartments with no daily nursing care. The high cost puts CCRC's out of the reach of the majority of seniors except for upper middle class and above. If there was a tax credit to help defray the monthly costs, then more seniors could afford to move to a CCRC after the sale of their homes and be able to continue to live there until their death or move into Nursing Care or Hospice.\nCurrently Seniors can't afford to move out of their existing SF homes because they have no place to move that they can afford. Renting is only good until they need more care, and by then they have used up a large portion of their savings on rent. (and the taxes on the sale of their home) Assisted Living and Nursing facilities are very expensive and require Medicare support.\nGiving Seniors a tax credit for a CCRC would allow more seniors to move into a CCRC and free up hundreds of thousands of SF homes around the US.\nIt would also spur the development of CCRCs around the country, particularly in urban areas. This would be a boost to local communities and keep Seniors near their families.\nIt is cheaper to keep a person in their own apartment in a CCRC, with visiting medical staff, then moving them into Assisted Living earlier than they need to go.\n\nFrom personal experience, a mother who was in Assisted Living and a father who is in a CCRC, the CCRC is a better place to be. Dad (93) has independence and privacy, he is in an active community, and has new friends. He is more physically active because of the lovely, landscaped campus with walking paths.\nCongress should give a tax break for CCRC residents over 70, for better quality of life, and to make more existing SF homes available to young families.

When we focus on the net capital share, which is not directly affected by government intervention, we do see a rebound in profitability after a sharp collapse, but this rebound does not look historically abnormal.\nConcluding remarks\nCorporate profit margins were not abnormally high in the aftermath of the COVID- 19 pandemic, once fiscal and monetary interventions are accounted for. This conclusion is supported by the behavior of the net capital share, which remained well below its historical high levels, and by firm-level profit margins across different size categories, which behaved broadly in line with their pre-COVID trends. If there is any anomaly to note, it should probably be that the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by a persistent weakness in the profitability of middle-sized publicly traded firms.",
